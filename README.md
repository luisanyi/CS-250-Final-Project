# CS-250-Final-Project

Week 8 Journal Submission Below this line:

1. I can interpret user needs into a program by envisioning what the user would want out of the program, then bring it to life. Mapping out the ideas into a logical sequence will allow me to best sequence program additions to ensure functionality is maintained as features are added. Creating user stories allows the user's perspective to be seen in terms of why a feature needs to be included. This also assists with pass/fail criteria to think of additional means to satisfy the user.
2. I approach developing programs through envisioning what the program should do, then work to achieve the goal. The user story agile organization method will be added to my programming toolkit. This is due to the amount of assistance it provides both the test cases, as well as feature envisioning is paramount to a successful program creation.
3. A good team member will coordinate responsibilities with their team members, as well as communicate regularly. The agile framework is perfect for this mindset in order to facilitate teamwork effectively. A good team member will also meet deadlines and offer assistance through correspondance regularly, as well as completing the portion of the work they have been tasked with. This will ensure the software will work correctly, if all members do their work correctly.
